            <p>I am a German student athlete living in Boston. In the classroom, I am studying interaction design and journalism. My first published piece as a writer was a Q&A with a person who dedicates his free time listening to strangers. You can have a look at it in the "work" section of my website. 
            As a design student, I have done some work on visual communication working with Illustrator and InDesign. And I designed this website!
            Last but not least, I am part of the Women's Rowing Team at Northeastern University and proud to be a Husky.
